! This file contains commands to be read in for a Pythia8 run.
! Lines not beginning with a letter or digit are comments.

! 1) Settings used in the main program.
Main:numberOfEvents = 20000        ! number of events to generate
Main:timesAllowErrors = 3          ! how many aborts before run stops

! 2) Settings related to output in init(), next() and stat().
Init:showChangedSettings = on      ! list changed settings
Init:showChangedParticleData = off ! list changed particle data
Next:numberCount = 500             ! print message every n events
Next:numberShowInfo = 2            ! print event information n times
Next:numberShowProcess = 2         ! print process record n times
Next:numberShowEvent = 2           ! print event record n times

! 3) Beam parameter settings. Values below agree with default ones.
Beams:idA = 2212                   ! first beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:idB = 2212                   ! second beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:eCM = 100000.                 ! CM energy of collision

! 4) Read SLHA spectrum (a few examples are provided by default)
#SLHA:file = point_mgluino_2000_mstop_3000.slha       ! Sample SLHA2 spectrum
#SLHA:file = slha1-example.spc       ! Sample SLHA1 spectrum, for CMSSM-10.1.1
#SLHA:file = sps1aWithDecays.spc     ! Older sample spectrum with DECAY tables

! 5) Process selection
Top:gg2ttbar = on
Top:qqbar2ttbar = on

! 6) Settings for the event generation process in the Pythia8 library.
PartonLevel:MPI = on              ! multiparton interactions
PartonLevel:ISR = on              ! initial-state radiation
PartonLevel:FSR = on              ! final-state radiation
HadronLevel:Hadronize = on        ! hadronization
PDF:pSet = 8					  ! Cteq 6L1 PDF set (default for Madgraph)
PhaseSpace:mHatMin = 5000
